# k8s-weave-Coreos-metal-USB
This is a repository that demos a kubernetes installation for bare metal nodes using coreos & weave, installed using: https://github.com/jriguera/coreos-usb-creator.  The whole thing is scripted until you need to install Coreos Using the USB drive.  

Do check out the script, I made it as simple and straightforward as possible and provided comments along the way.  

In terms of use-case, this is for a fairly unconventional experiment blending concepts from cluster federation and hybrid cloud topologies.  In the end, the goal is to create a less hierarchical, more p2p arrangement for cloud deployments that users can initiate on their own ("seed") or easily join a larger managed cluster while enjoying the lower cost and better performance of on premesis metal.
